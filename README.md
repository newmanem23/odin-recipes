# Odin Recipes
The Odin Project - Recipe Project

This project is essentially a home page with a list of links to recipes. The purpose of the project is to learn about html and the basic elements of a web page. In this case, each page includes headings, an image of the recipe, as well as lists for the ingredients and directions.
